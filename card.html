			<p>The cheetah is characterised by a slender body, deep chest, spotted coat, small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, long thin legs and long spotted tail.
			   Cheetahs can reach speeds of 112 km/h (70 mph) in short bursts, but this is disputed by more recent measurements.
			   The average speed of cheetahs is about 64 km/h (40 mph).
			   Although taller than the leopard, it is notably smaller than the lion. Cheetahs inhabit a variety of habitats â€“ dry forests, scrub forests and savannahs.</p>
